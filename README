MEME Roll
---------

This roll will install MEME on your Rocks cluster.
It requires the bio roll and the opal roll.
This roll contains the software used to power 
http://nbcr-222.ucsd.edu/meme/

The MEME software is http://ebi.edu.au/ftp/software/MEME

For meme 4.10.0 requests to *_request.cgi are not passed to tomcat.
None of the httpd/tomct configs worked. 

AU team finally released  an official patch 3 Jan 6 2015 
which updates web.xml to create new servlet-mappings 

Rewrite meme-nbcr.conf and add to /etc/http/conf.d/ during roll install.
This provides for accessing meme via meme.nbcr.net and meme.sdsc.edu aliases.
Will need to remove meme-nbcr.conf  when  meme server goes away.
