1 script <roll>/ bootstrap.sh (in the roll base dir)
  Run before making a roll.  Make sure specified rpms are installed.
  Need them during meme build for creating db csv files. 

2 When updating to a NEW version X (in src/meme/):
  2.1 Create memeX/ and copy relevant files from previous version
  2.2 Update gomo_db.csv and motif_db.csv: 
      extract them from <roll>/src/meme-db/*.tgz files and put in memeX/patch-files/memeX/etc
      These allows for creation of index files during compile step.
      IMPORTANT: When updating gomo or motif databases distros update these patch files. 
  2.3 Update versions in src/version.mk 
  2.4 In meme-previous/ create last.mk and sert versions according to new-old verison scheme for the version.
      Update target version.mk in Makefile to use last.mk

3 When updating meme DBs (in src/meme-db/):
  download from http://ebi.edu.au/ftp/software/MEME/index.html
  gomo_databases.tgz  - corresponds to gomo_databases.3.tgz  (updated Jun 18 2010) 
  motif_databases.10.3.tgz - updated Nov 2013  
  update motif_db.csv and gomo_Db.csv files in memeX/etc and memeX-1/etc

4 File <roll>src/rocks-meme/meme-logs
  don't make it a part of the distro, too NBCR specific.
  Update when needed and drop in manually in /etc/cron.daily on the frontend.

5 For patch fasta-get-markov.patch for meme 4.9.0
  patch added 2013-06-12
  add  to meme/Makefile lines (before configure)
     aclocal;                      \
     autoreconf --force --install; \  
  since this patch changes Makefil.am files and new
  Makefile.in and autoconf-related tools have to be generated anew. 
  Remove these lines when patches are incorporated in next meme version.
