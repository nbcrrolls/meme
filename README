MEME Roll
---------

This roll will install MEME on your Rocks cluster.
It requires the bio roll and the opal roll.
This roll contains the software used to power 
http://nbcr-222.ucsd.edu/meme/

The MEME software is http://ebi.edu.au/ftp/software/MEME


For meme 4.10.0 requests to *_request.cgi are not passed by tomcat. 
None of the httpd/tomct configs worked. 
For a workaround send all cgi requests to AU server. Run config/build
for meme410 as 
                        --with-url=http://meme.ebi.edu.au/meme/
in place of
                        --with-url=http://rollhost/meme_$(MEMEVER)
