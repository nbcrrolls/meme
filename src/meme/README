1 script ../ bootstrap.sh (in the roll base dir)
  Run before making a roll.  Make sure specified rpms are installed.
  Need them during meme build for creating db csv files. 

2 When updating to a NEW versionX (in src/meme/):
  2.1 Update gomo_db.csv and motif_db.csv: extract them from meme/src/meme-db/*.tgz files and put in 
         src/meme/patch-files/versionX/etc
         src/meme-previous/patch-files/versionX/etc
      These allows for creation of index files during compile step.
      When updateing gomo or motif databases distros update these patch files. 

  2.2 Update both versions in src/version.mk (new and previous)

  2.3 mkdir meme/patch-files/versionX/etc/ and add patched Makefile.in 
      Patching: make targets install-data-hook and uninstall-hook empty (related to opal service deploy)

  2.4 meme-previous/Makefile is based on meme/Makefile. 
      If meme/Makefile changes, this file needs modification.

3 When updating meme DBs (in src/meme-db/):
  download from http://ebi.edu.au/ftp/software/MEME/index.html
    gomo_databases.tgz  - corresponds to gomo_databases.3.tgz  (updated Jun 18 2010) 
    motif_databases.tgz - corresponds to motif_databases.9.tgz (updated Jan 31 2013)

4 File src/rocks-meme/meme-logs
  don't make it a part of the distro, too NBCR specific.
  Update when needed and drop in manually in /etc/cron.daily on the frontend.

5 For patch fasta-get-markov.patch for meme 4.9.0
  patch added 2013-06-12
  add  to meme/Makefile lines (before configure)
     aclocal;                      \
     autoreconf --force --install; \  

  since this patch changes Makefil.am files and new
  Makefile.in and autoconf-related tools have to be generated anew. 
  Remove these lines when patches are incorporated in next meme version.
