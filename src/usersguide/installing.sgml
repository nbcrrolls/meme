<title>Installing MEME Roll </title>

<simplesect>
<title>On a New Server</title>
<para>
The MEME roll can be installed during the initial installation of your cluster. This procedure is documented
in the <ulink url="http://yourservername/roll-documentation/base/&document-version;/installing.html">Rocks usersguide </ulink>.
You should select the MEME roll from the list of available rolls when you see a screen that lists
the available rolls. This requires an MEME roll to be added to your network rolls server.
If your network server does not have this roll added, the roll can be added from a CD media (burn a CD with the roll iso).

<simplesect>
<title>On an Existing Server</title>

<para>
The MEME roll may also be added to an existing server (or frontend). For sake of discussion, 
assume that you have an iso image of the roll called meme-&document-version;.iso. 
The following procedure will install the roll, and deploy the webservice. 
</para>

<screen>
$ su - root
# rocks add roll meme-&document-version;.iso
# rocks enable roll meme
# cd /export/rocks/install; rocks create distro
# rocks run roll meme | bash
</screen>

<title>Adding roll to the nodes </title>
<para>
To add the the MEME roll to the nodes of your cluster, you'll need to reinstall the nodes.
To reinstall all your nodes, as root execute:
<screen>
# rocks set host compute boot action=install
# rocks run host compute command=reboot
</screen>
